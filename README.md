# Tracking.my Interview Assessments

1. Design an ERD for an E-commerce database system.
1. Build a simple CRUD complete todo-list application in PHP, preferably Laravel.
1. Complete a VueJS reversi game, preferably with two modes: Player vs Player, or Player vs CPU. Integrate CPU AI to play against the player.

### Notes

The hardest is the VueJS reversi game. I had to understand the rules of reversi, implement a Minimax-based heuristic AI algorithm to play against the player.
